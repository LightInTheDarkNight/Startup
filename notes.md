# Notes for the Class!

## Useful git commands
- gh repo clone
    - for cloning repositories
- git push
- git pull
  - In the event of a conflict, using VS Code is much easier than trying to use notepad, lol.
- git fetch
- git commit -am "(message)"
    - commits all tracked files with the message


## Markdown Syntax
- Links:
  - [text](link.com)
  - section links can be done more easily on github
  - relative links:
      - root: /
      - from current directory: folder/folder/file
        - e.g. Here is the link to the [ReadMe](README.md) file
- images:
  - ![Alt Text](image link - this one doesn't work)
