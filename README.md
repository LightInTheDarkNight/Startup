## Specification

### Pitch

Imagine a roguelike game that you can
cooperate on with your friends! So you can play like a wizard, your friend can hold the knives, and you have to find the exit for the maze! It would adjust the difficulty and size of the dungeon maze depending on how many players were in the game when the level was generated, so you can play in the same game alone and with friends, and it would support an integrated chat so you could collaborate real-time.
